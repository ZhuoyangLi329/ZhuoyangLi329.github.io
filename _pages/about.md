I am a PhD student in Department of Astronomy, Tsinghua University. My main research interest is cosmology. I am currently conducting research under the supervision of Prof. Cheng Li

My recent research works
======
1. ***<u>Isotropic two-point statistics.</u>***:The two-point correlation function(2PCF) is a fundamental tool used in cosmology to study the large-scale structure of the universe by measuring how matter is clustered. Traditional 2PCF is obtained by dividing the distance range into spherical shells and calculating the density correlation within each shell. If we replace the spherical shells with an anisotropic shape(e.g a cylinder) , for correlation analysis, can it provide us with more cosmological information? We will use a fast algorithm called 'MRA-CS'(Feng, 2004), which enable us to explore the two point or higher order statistics efficiently in large data sets, to accomplish this task.

2. ***<u>Spectral survey and kSZ measurement</u>***: In this work, we discuss three issues: 1. The pros and cons of seamless spectral surveys (such as CSST) and segmented spectral surveys (such as DESI) in parameter estimation.  2. In seamless spectral surveys, how much does the Nsys parameter affect the error in parameter estimation? 3. What improvements in parameter estimation can be achieved by combining spectral surveys with kSZ measurements? We predict the answers to these three issues by calculating the redshift space galaxy power spectrum and kSZ power spectrum, as well as their corresponding Fisher matrices.
